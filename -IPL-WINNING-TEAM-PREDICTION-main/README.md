## Project Overview
Welcome to the "IPL Win Predictor" project! This machine learning model uses logistic regression to predict the probability of a team winning an IPL match based on the current match situation. Get ready to make data-driven predictions!

### Features
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Get live predictions for IPL match outcomes based on the current match situation.
- **Interactive Interface:** Deployed on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring match scenarios.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Adjust match parameters and teams to simulate different match scenarios.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and sharing.

### Usage
To make predictions, provide the following parameters:
- **Batting Team:** The team currently batting.
- **Bowling Team:** The team currently bowling.
- **City:** The location of the match.
- **Current Score:** The current score of the batting team.
- **Overs Completed:** The number of overs completed.
- **Wickets Fallen:** The number of wickets lost.
- **Target Runs:** The total runs set by the bowling team.

The predictor calculates the probability of the batting team winning based on these parameters and the current match situation.
